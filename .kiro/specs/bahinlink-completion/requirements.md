# Requirements Document: BahinLink System Completion

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements to complete the BahinLink Security Workforce Management System. After comprehensive analysis of the codebase, the system has a solid foundation with backend API, database schema, and frontend portals partially implemented, but contains numerous broken API implementations, non-functional UI components, and incomplete features that prevent production deployment.

**Critical Issues Identified:**
- Admin Portal: Scheduling page has no API integration (empty arrays), monitoring page has broken Google Maps integration, user management has incomplete CRUD operations
- Client Portal: Service requests page has broken API calls, dashboard analytics fail to load, report access manager has non-functional download buttons
- Backend API: Many endpoints return placeholder data, missing authentication middleware on critical routes, incomplete WebSocket implementation
- Mobile App: Redux store actions fail due to missing API endpoints, offline sync logic incomplete, camera/media upload not implemented
- Infrastructure: No production monitoring, incomplete Docker configurations, missing environment variable validation

The primary goal is to fix these broken implementations and deliver a fully functional mobile-first workforce management solution that enables real-time tracking, comprehensive reporting, seamless communication, and robust offline capabilities for security personnel management.
