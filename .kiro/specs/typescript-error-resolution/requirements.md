# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The project has 61 TypeScript compilation errors across 19 files in multiple applications (admin-portal, client-portal, mobile-app, backend, and services). These errors are preventing successful builds and need to be systematically resolved to ensure code quality, maintainability, and successful deployment.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to fix missing import statements so that all TypeScript components compile successfully.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN building any application THEN there SHALL be no "is not defined" errors for React components
2. WHEN using Material-UI components THEN all required imports SHALL be present in the import statements
3. WHEN reviewing import statements THEN they SHALL be properly ordered and follow ESLint rules

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to resolve API method reference errors so that all service calls work correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN calling API methods THEN all method names SHALL exist in the API service definitions
2. WHEN using adminAPI methods THEN they SHALL be properly defined in the API service
3. WHEN referencing API endpoints THEN they SHALL match the actual backend implementation

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to fix TypeScript type errors so that the codebase has proper type safety.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using TypeScript interfaces THEN all properties SHALL be properly typed
2. WHEN passing parameters to functions THEN they SHALL match the expected type signatures
3. WHEN using generic types THEN they SHALL be properly constrained and defined

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to resolve unused variable and import warnings so that the code is clean and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN importing modules THEN only used imports SHALL be included
2. WHEN declaring variables THEN they SHALL be used or removed
3. WHEN destructuring objects THEN only needed properties SHALL be extracted

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to fix import ordering and module structure issues so that the code follows best practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN organizing imports THEN they SHALL be ordered according to ESLint rules
2. WHEN importing from modules THEN imports SHALL be at the top of files
3. WHEN using relative imports THEN they SHALL follow consistent patterns

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to ensure all applications build successfully so that deployment and development workflows work correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running npm run build THEN all applications SHALL compile without errors
2. WHEN running TypeScript compiler THEN there SHALL be zero compilation errors
3. WHEN running ESLint THEN there SHALL be no blocking errors that prevent builds
