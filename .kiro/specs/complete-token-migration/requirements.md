# Complete Token Migration Requirements

## Introduction

This specification addresses the systematic completion of token handling migration across all remaining components in the admin portal, client portal, and mobile app. Currently, there are approximately 50+ components that still use manual token handling patterns, causing terminal errors and inconsistent authentication behavior.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Complete Admin Portal Token Migration

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want all admin portal components to use centralized token handling, so that authentication is consistent and maintainable across the entire admin interface.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any admin portal component needs authentication THEN it SHALL use `isAuthenticationAvailable()` and `getCurrentTokenInfo()` from the enhanced API service
2. WHEN any admin portal component makes API calls THEN it SHALL use the centralized `adminAPI` service instead of manual fetch calls
3. WHEN any admin portal component encounters authentication errors THEN it SHALL display consistent, user-friendly error messages
4. WHEN any admin portal component is in development mode THEN it SHALL automatically fall back to development tokens
5. IF any admin portal component currently imports `useClerkAuth` THEN it SHALL be updated to use the enhanced token system
6. WHEN any admin portal component uses `getToken()` directly THEN it SHALL be replaced with the centralized authentication pattern

### Requirement 2: Complete Client Portal Token Migration

**User Story:** As a client user, I want all client portal components to use centralized token handling, so that my authentication experience is seamless and secure across all client features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any client portal component needs authentication THEN it SHALL use `isAuthenticationAvailable()` and `getCurrentTokenInfo()` from the enhanced API service
2. WHEN any client portal component makes API calls THEN it SHALL use the centralized `clientAPI` service instead of manual fetch calls
3. WHEN any client portal component encounters authentication errors THEN it SHALL display consistent, user-friendly error messages
4. WHEN any client portal component is in development mode THEN it SHALL automatically fall back to development tokens
5. IF any client portal component currently imports `useClerkAuth` THEN it SHALL be updated to use the enhanced token system
6. WHEN any client portal component uses `getToken()` directly THEN it SHALL be replaced with the centralized authentication pattern

### Requirement 3: Fix Import Statement Inconsistencies

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all import statements to be consistent and correct, so that the application compiles without errors and maintains clean code standards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any component imports authentication utilities THEN it SHALL import from the correct enhanced API service
2. WHEN any component no longer needs `useClerkAuth` THEN the import SHALL be removed completely
3. WHEN any component uses both old and new authentication patterns THEN it SHALL be updated to use only the new pattern
4. WHEN any component has unused imports THEN they SHALL be removed to maintain clean code
5. IF any component has conflicting authentication imports THEN they SHALL be resolved to use only the enhanced system

### Requirement 4: Standardize Error Handling

**User Story:** As a user of the system, I want consistent error messages and handling across all components, so that I understand what's happening when authentication issues occur.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any component encounters authentication unavailability THEN it SHALL display "Authentication not available. Please log in."
2. WHEN any component encounters token-related errors THEN it SHALL log debug information using `getCurrentTokenInfo()`
3. WHEN any component fails API calls due to authentication THEN it SHALL provide actionable error messages
4. WHEN any component is in loading state due to authentication THEN it SHALL set loading states appropriately
5. IF any component has custom error handling THEN it SHALL be standardized to match the enhanced pattern

### Requirement 5: Complete Mobile App Token Migration

**User Story:** As a mobile app user, I want all mobile components to use centralized token handling, so that authentication works consistently across all mobile features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any mobile component needs authentication THEN it SHALL use `isAuthenticationAvailable()` and `getCurrentTokenInfo()` from the mobile API service
2. WHEN any mobile component makes API calls THEN it SHALL use the centralized `mobileAPI` service instead of manual fetch calls
3. WHEN any mobile component encounters authentication errors THEN it SHALL display appropriate Alert messages
4. WHEN any mobile component is in development mode THEN it SHALL automatically fall back to development tokens
5. IF any mobile component currently uses manual token handling THEN it SHALL be updated to use the enhanced system

### Requirement 6: Validate Complete Migration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to ensure all components have been successfully migrated, so that there are no remaining manual token handling patterns in the codebase.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN searching the codebase for `getToken()` THEN it SHALL only appear in token provider classes and enhanced API services
2. WHEN searching the codebase for `useClerkAuth` THEN it SHALL only appear in necessary authentication contexts
3. WHEN searching the codebase for manual `Authorization: Bearer` headers THEN they SHALL only appear in legacy or test files
4. WHEN running the application THEN there SHALL be no authentication-related terminal errors
5. WHEN testing authentication flows THEN all components SHALL work consistently with the enhanced system

### Requirement 7: Update Component Dependencies

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all component dependencies to be correctly updated, so that the application has proper type safety and imports.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any component uses the enhanced API services THEN it SHALL have the correct import statements
2. WHEN any component no longer needs manual token handling THEN unused dependencies SHALL be removed
3. WHEN any component uses authentication utilities THEN it SHALL import them from the correct service files
4. WHEN any component has callback dependencies THEN they SHALL be updated to remove `getToken` references
5. IF any component has TypeScript errors due to authentication changes THEN they SHALL be resolved

### Requirement 8: Maintain Backward Compatibility

**User Story:** As a system maintainer, I want the migration to maintain existing functionality, so that users don't experience any disruption in service.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any component is migrated THEN it SHALL maintain the same user-facing functionality
2. WHEN any API call is updated THEN it SHALL call the same backend endpoints
3. WHEN any authentication flow is changed THEN it SHALL provide the same user experience
4. WHEN any error occurs THEN it SHALL be handled gracefully without breaking the component
5. IF any component has specific business logic THEN it SHALL be preserved during migration
