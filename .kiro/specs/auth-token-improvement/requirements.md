# Authentication Token Improvement Requirements

## Introduction

The current authentication system is functional but generates warnings due to improper token handling. The frontend sends email addresses as Bearer tokens instead of proper JWT tokens, causing the backend to attempt JWT validation on email strings, which fails and falls back to email-based authentication. This creates unnecessary error logs and reduces system reliability.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Proper Token Type Detection

**User Story:** As a backend authentication service, I want to properly detect token types, so that I don't attempt JWT validation on email addresses.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a token is received THEN the system SHALL determine if it's a JWT token or email address before processing
2. WHEN a token starts with "eyJ" THEN the system SHALL treat it as a JWT token
3. WHEN a token contains "@" and doesn't start with "eyJ" THEN the system SHALL treat it as an email address
4. WHEN token type is determined THEN the system SHALL use the appropriate validation method

### Requirement 2: Eliminate JWT Validation Warnings

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want clean authentication logs, so that I can easily identify real authentication issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an email address is used as a token THEN the system SHALL NOT attempt JWT validation
2. WHEN JWT validation is skipped for email tokens THEN no warning logs SHALL be generated
3. WHEN authentication succeeds via email fallback THEN only success logs SHALL be recorded
4. WHEN authentication fails THEN appropriate error logs SHALL be generated with clear reasons

### Requirement 3: Improved Frontend Token Handling

**User Story:** As a frontend application, I want to send proper authentication tokens, so that backend authentication is efficient and clean.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Clerk token is available THEN the frontend SHALL send the JWT token
2. WHEN Clerk token is unavailable THEN the frontend SHALL send a properly formatted development token
3. WHEN using email-based development auth THEN the token SHALL be prefixed with "dev:" to indicate type
4. WHEN making API requests THEN the token type SHALL be clearly identifiable

### Requirement 4: Enhanced Development Authentication

**User Story:** As a developer, I want reliable development authentication, so that I can work efficiently without authentication issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN in development mode THEN email-based authentication SHALL work without warnings
2. WHEN using development tokens THEN they SHALL be clearly marked as development tokens
3. WHEN development authentication is used THEN appropriate debug logs SHALL be generated
4. WHEN switching between development and production THEN authentication SHALL work seamlessly

### Requirement 5: Robust Error Handling

**User Story:** As a system user, I want clear feedback when authentication fails, so that I understand what action to take.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages
2. WHEN token validation fails THEN the reason SHALL be logged appropriately
3. WHEN fallback authentication is used THEN the user SHALL be informed of the authentication method
4. WHEN authentication succeeds THEN the authentication method SHALL be logged for audit purposes
