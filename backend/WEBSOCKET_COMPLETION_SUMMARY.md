- Public method testing

### Test Results
```
‚úÖ WebSocket service initialized successfully
‚úÖ Authentication middleware configured
‚úÖ Event handlers registered
‚úÖ Redis subscriptions setup
‚úÖ All WebSocket tests passed!
```

## üìä Database Integration

### Models Used
- `TrackingLog` - Location data storage
- `Incident` - Emergency alerts and violations
- `Communication` - Messages and notifications
- `AgentProfile` - Agent information
- `Shift` - Current shift data
- `Site` - Geofence definitions

### Data Flow
1. **Location Updates**: Agent ‚Üí WebSocket ‚Üí LocationService ‚Üí Database + Cache
2. **Emergency Alerts**: Agent ‚Üí WebSocket ‚Üí EmergencyAlertService ‚Üí Database + Broadcast
3. **Messaging**: User ‚Üí WebSocket ‚Üí Database ‚Üí Target Users

## üîÑ Real-Time Features

### Location Broadcasting
- Agents send GPS coordinates via WebSocket
- Supervisors receive real-time location updates
- Automatic geofence violation detection
- Battery level and accuracy monitoring

### Emergency Alerts
- Instant alert creation and broadcasting
- Multi-level escalation (immediate, 5min, 15min)
- Alert acknowledgment and resolution
- Priority-based handling (HIGH/CRITICAL)

### Communication
- Private messaging between users
- Group/room-based communication
- Broadcast messages to specific roles
- Typing indicators and presence tracking

## üöÄ Deployment Ready

### Production Considerations
- Redis server integration
- WebSocket load balancing support
- Horizontal scaling capabilities
- Health check endpoints
- Comprehensive logging and monitoring

### Environment Configuration
```env
