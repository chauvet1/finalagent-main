# Admin Login Page Test States

## URL to Test: http://localhost:3000/admin/login

## Expected Behavior:

### State 1: Not Signed In
**What you should see:**
- Page title: "Admin Portal Access"
- Subtitle: "Sign in with your administrator credentials to access the admin dashboard"
- **Clerk Sign-In Form** (email/password fields)
- Info alert: "Admin Access Required - Please sign in with an administrator or supervisor account"

### State 2: Signed In as Admin User
**What you should see:**
- Page title: "Admin Portal Access"
- Green success message: "✅ Admin Access Granted"
- Welcome message with your name/email
- Two buttons:
  - **"Access Admin Portal"** (opens localhost:3001 in new tab)
  - **"Access Client Portal (Support Mode)"** (goes to client dashboard)
- Explanation text about the difference between admin and client portals

### State 3: Signed In as Non-Admin User
**What you should see:**
- Page title: "Admin Portal Access"
- Warning message: "⚠️ Insufficient Privileges"
- Shows your email address
- Message: "This account does not have administrator privileges"
- Two buttons:
  - **"Sign Out & Try Different Account"**
  - **"Back to Home"**

## Debug Information:
Check the browser console (F12 → Console) for debug output showing:
- isLoaded: true/false
- isSignedIn: true/false
- hasUser: true/false
- userRole: 'ADMIN', 'CLIENT', etc.
- isAdminUser: true/false

## Testing Steps:

1. **Test Not Signed In:**
   - Open incognito/private browser window
   - Go to http://localhost:3000/admin/login
   - Should see Clerk sign-in form

2. **Test Admin User:**
   - Sign in with your admin account (xsmafred@gmail.com)
   - Should see admin access options
   - Click "Access Admin Portal" - should open localhost:3001

3. **Test Non-Admin User:**
   - Sign out and sign in with a client account
   - Should see insufficient privileges message

## Current Issue Resolution:
The page now properly handles all three states and provides clear options for admin users to access the admin portal without automatic redirect issues.
